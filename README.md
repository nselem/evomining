Then type:

* This are Linux minimal docker installation guide, if you don't use Linux or you are looking for a detailed tutorial on Linux/Windows/Mac docker engine installation please consult [Docker getting Starting](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/). 
    
  
###### Important step:   
Log out from your ubuntu session (restart your machine) and get back in into your user session before the next step.

`$ docker run hello-world`

### 2 Download EvoMining images from DockerHub  
Pull evomining docker image from dockerHub with the following command:   
`$ docker pull nselem/evomining:latest  `

## 3 Run evomining image  

### 3.1 Run evomining image
Place yourself at your working directory.    
 `$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 80:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash`

sometimes the port 80 is bussy, on that case you can use other ports like 8080 or 8084:    
`$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 8080:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash`  
`$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 8084:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash`  

### 3.2 Set databases  
Initialize EvoMining pipeline on the interactive shell of the EvoMining docker image.  
To run a default data included on docker distribution use:  
`# perl startEvoMining.pl`  
  
To run EvoMining with your own databases use the modifiers:  
`# perl startEvoMining.pl -g <genome-DB> -r <myRastIds> -c <central-DB> -n <natural-DB> -a <antismash_db>`   
Or follow the example tutorial.    

### 3.3 View your results  
Open EvoMining web interface and follow the steps until the tree visualization.  
If you are running EvoMining on your local machine.   
`http://localhost/EvoMining/html/index.html`   
   
or, if you are running EvoMining on a remote machine.   
`http://<yourip>/EvoMining/html/index.html`  

### 3.4 Common fails  
  
Some computers do not have writing permission and do not let EvoMining run, go one level up of your directory and change permissions 
`mkdir mydir`  
`sudo chmod +x mydir`    
`sudo chmod +w mydir`    
`cd mydir`  
and then inside mydir run EvoMining.  
Also inside the docker you can change permissions as:  
`chmod 770 ../exchange`
